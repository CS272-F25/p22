## Project Title  
Smart Sausage

## Project Description

Smart Sausage is a fun and engaging online learning platform designed to make education interactive, social, and entertaining. The project is inspired by websites such as GeoGuessr, Human Benchmark, and Philosophy Experiments, which prioritize curiosity, experimentation, and challenge over traditional academic formats.

Instead of functioning like study tools such as Quizlet or Coursera, Smart Sausage aims to be a lighthearted and fast-paced experience that users can enjoy when they are bored, want to compete with friends, or want to learn something new without feeling like they are studying.

The platform offers subject-based quizzes and flashcards that help learners explore different topics in an enjoyable way. Subjects currently include Math, Science, Geography, History, and Art. Each quiz includes short facts or playful challenges to make the experience both educational and memorable.

In future iterations, Smart Sausage will introduce additional features, such as a Leaderboard System that tracks user progress and supports friendly competition. Planned additions include login/sign-up functionality, user statistics, challenge streaks, and multiplayer or social features.

Smart Sausage is designed to promote curiosity, discovery, and casual learning through simple interactions and short, engaging activities. The focus is on making knowledge accessible and enjoyable rather than academic or formal.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of Smart Sausage is to create a learning environment that is informal, playful, and accessible. It is intended for users who want to explore interesting topics, challenge themselves, or compete with friends in a low-pressure setting. The project emphasizes simplicity, creativity, and general curiosity rather than rigorous academic study.
