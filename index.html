    <h4>About the Creators</h4>
      <p>Smart Sausage was created by three Computer Science majors from the University of Wisconsin–Madison who share a passion for building tools that make learning easier, more fun, and more accessible. What started as a small project between friends quickly grew into a playful platform designed to support students, spark curiosity, and bring a bit of joy to the learning experience.</p>
